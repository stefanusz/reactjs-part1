READ BEFORE DWELLING FURTHER IN.


This is a tryout skeleton for reactjs. This is a learning stage of reactjs.

I'm making the skeleton as I go and will be using node & npm for module management.

The packages that I will be using:

1. Bablelify
2. Watchify
3. Node
4. npm

There could be changes that happens at any time, so use with caution or change as you deem necessary.
